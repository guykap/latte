Design:
----------
Option 1:
------------
second tread - Updating the SQL on Cloud from the memory Jobs List

Option 2:
---------
not having any List of Jobs - only using the Cloud SQL


Toughts on design

String why Decision - explains why the decisiion was made
-emailing the updates of the Submitted jobs only. So when CD calls me on the phone i know what to say
Aklways know which page we are on.
And if one type of click dooesn't-
Should not restart every failure. 
A difference if a pop up window doesn't open or the role has been submitted for - I whould map out all the options.

add shootdate to decision making in the event i;m' already booked on a certain date.
-behave like a human - so login would be in UNEVEN time spaces, pretend to sleep at night
-do not have any constancy in online action
-change the way behave in site - like go to the other options of links 
-alternate the time sleep between action Randomized
-alternate messages on the talent notes.

-Build a site that has a blog.
-Thsi Blog will be the GUI. The Pamela output will save to local file and also post every minute to the blog.
I will be able to read from any browser the latest updates.
-Also there will be a combo box  / text input  where i will assign the setup flags to change the logging, decision making 
simple changes like : "SUBMIT TO ALL" / "SUBMIT ONLY TO MALE" / " ONLY TO SPECIFIC"/"ONLY UNION "
-use parser (maybe p ) to parse the logs and create a simple to look at chart of what whs asbmitted and how many errors were there.
-add a function get_Time() - that returns the current time in NY.maybe via a json web api
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp
-right now only looking at top offer. We should look at the top 10 offers
-list of banned productions.TODO
-------------
TODO -SQL DB on cloud.
-Clean Code - functions , clear working 
-Decision making - age, union issues, 
-messaging 
-error handeling:
	 - what happened if network falls, 
	 -what happens when role disappease from site
	  - what happens in the prog gets stuck - after 2 min. of stuck - how to rebot itself
